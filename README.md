## Introduction

Accurate sales forecasting is essential for maximising inventory, resource allocation, and decision-making processes in the dynamic world of retail. In this project, we delve into the realm of time series forecasting for store sales, aiming to provide a robust predictive model for Favorita, a leading Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. By harnessing the power of data and advanced analytics, we seek to enhance Favorita's operations, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

By leveraging historical sales data and relevant supplementary information, the model aims to provide reliable forecasts that enable Favorita to optimize its inventory management, resource allocation, and marketing strategies. The successful implementation of this model will contribute to improved operational efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and increased profitability for the retailer.
